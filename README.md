*IMPORTANT - you will need to use JAVA 17 for all operating systems*

Welcome to the Scotland Yard Board Game! This repository contains the source code for an interactive digital version of the classic board game "Scotland Yard." Follow the instructions below to set up your development environment and run the game.

The implementation of a core game component `Model`

The implementation of an open-ended AI extension `AI`

In preparation for more advanced strategic planning, update the implementation of the MiniMax algorithm, along with Alpha-Beta pruning to enhance performance by reducing the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree.
